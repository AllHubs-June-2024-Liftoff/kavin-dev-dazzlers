This program is taking in information from the moviedock mysql database, specifically user reviews and ratings and outputting a csv file with a list of movie recommendations. The model has been created using the movielens dataset from kaggle.
Movie_rec.py is using a machine learning technique here known as item-item collaborative filtering, that takes in a dataset of users and the items they have reviewed and returns a model of item similarity.
The model is created by taking the user/item matrix containing the user/movie reviews of each movie in the data set and creating a model that clusters together similar movies. From here the distance can be found between movies, showing similarities.
From here movies that have been rated highly or favorited by a user can output recommended movies to a file which can then be displayed to the user.
